`pip install -e .`

### Contributing to SwiftPol

Features should be developed on branches. To create and switch to a branch, use the command

`git checkout -b < new_branch_name >`

To switch to an existing branch, use

`git checkout < new_branch_name >`

To submit your feature to be incorporated to the main branch, you should submit a Pull Request. The repository maintainers will review your pull request before accepting your changes.
